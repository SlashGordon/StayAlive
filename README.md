# Stay Alive

The "Stay Alive" application is designed to keep your computer's session active by simulating human-like mouse movements. This tool is especially useful for preventing your screen from locking automatically when you're away from your keyboard for an extended period but need to keep your session active.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get "Stay Alive" running on your machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. "Stay Alive" requires Go version 1.21.5 or higher. You can check your Go version by running:

`go version`

If you need to install Go, follow the instructions on the [official Go website](https://golang.org/doc/install).

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/SlashGordon/stay-alive.git`

Navigate to the project directory:

`cd stay-alive`

Build the project:

`go build`

Run the application:

`./stay-alive`


## Usage

Once "Stay Alive" is running, it will automatically move the mouse cursor in a human-like manner at random intervals. To stop the program, simply move the mouse cursor significantly or close the terminal window.
